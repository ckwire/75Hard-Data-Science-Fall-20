## 75Hard - 75 Days of Data Science & Machine Learning 

This page will be used to track daily progress starting on Sept 28, 2020 of my 75 Days of Data Science.
I will be working throw improving my Python skills as that is a new language for me. I will then progress onto a Python web framework (Flask or Django) which I have not picked yet. Then will start working through Data Science and Machine Learning topics and frameworks. 

**Requirements will be similar to that of #75Hard Challenge.**

Goals are to improve overall programming skills, improve upon Python skills. Learn new data science framworks.

Any information used will be referenced. 

Textbooks I will be using are:
* Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes)
* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Keras & TensorFlow 2nd Edition (GÃ©ron)
* Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python (Bruce, Peter)


**Rough Schedule:**
* Python (Python Crash Course chapter reference)
  * [x] Basics
  * [ ] Input (7), Functions (8)
  * [ ] Classes (9)
  * [ ] Files (10), Testing (11)
  * [ ] Project 2 (15)
  * [ ] Data (16), APIs (17)
  * [ ] Web Django (18-20)
  
* Personal Project - WITS 2.0 Python (rebuild old [WITS](https://github.com/ckwire/WITS) PHP version into Python & Django)
  
* Start ML/AI book & learning
