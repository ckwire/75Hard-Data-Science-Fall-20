75Hard - 75 Days of Data Science & Machine Learning

This page will be used to track daily progress starting on Sept 28, 2020 of my 75 Days of Data Science.
I will be working throw improving my Python skills as that is a new language for me. I will then progress onto a Python web framework (Flask or Django) which I have not picked yet. Then will start working through Data Science and Machine Learning topics and frameworks. 

Requirements will be similar to that of #75Hard Challenge.

Goals are to improve overall programming skills, improve upon Python skills. Learn new data science framworks.

Any information used will be referenced. 

Textbooks I will be using are:
-Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes), 
-Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Keras & TensorFlow 2nd Edition (GÃ©ron)
