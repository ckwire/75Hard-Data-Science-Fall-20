## 75Hard > 75 Days of Data Science & Machine Learning #My75DaysOfDS

This page will be used to track daily progress starting on Oct 1, 2020 of my 75 Days of Data Science.
I will be working throw improving my Python skills as that is a new language for me. I will then progress onto a Python web framework (Flask or Django) which I have not picked yet. Then will start working through Data Science and Machine Learning topics and frameworks. 

**Requirements will be similar to that of #75Hard Challenge.**
* [ ] Spend 20 minutes minimum related to learning Data Science.
  * Can be tutorial or video, or coding.
* [ ] Commit a **daily** log of what was done along with any code files.

Goals are to improve overall programming skills, improve upon Python skills. Learn new data science frameworks.

Any information used will be referenced. 

Textbooks I will be using are:
* Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes)
* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Keras & TensorFlow 2nd Edition (GÃ©ron)
* Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python (Bruce, Peter)


**Rough Schedule:**
* Python (Python Crash Course chapter reference)
  * [x] Basics
  * [x] Input (7)
  * [x] Functions (8)
  * [x] Classes (9)
  * [x] Files (10)
  * [ ] Testing (11)
  * [ ] Project 2 (15)
  * [ ] Data (16), APIs (17)
  * [ ] Web Django (18-20)
  
* Personal Project - WITS 2.0 Python (rebuild old [WITS](https://github.com/ckwire/WITS) PHP version into Python & Django)
  
* Start ML/AI book & learning
