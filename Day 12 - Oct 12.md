* What to do today?

    Gather and sanitize data. One of many goals of learning Data Science / ML / AI is to take data from local fire department calls and analyze location and time and day of the week and see if we can't predict or see any trends in our call data. Initial data is from Dec 2018 - Today ( 10/12/2020 )
