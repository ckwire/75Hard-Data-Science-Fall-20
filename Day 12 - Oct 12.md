## OCTOBER 12th 2020 - DAY 12 - DAILY LOG ##

* What to do today?

    Gather and sanitize data. One of many goals of learning Data Science / ML / AI is to take data from local fire department calls and analyze location and time and day of the week and see if we can't predict or see any trends in our call data. Initial data is from Dec 2018 - Today ( 10/12/2020 ).

    Data will not be at released for this. Possibly the results from such datasets might be as they would never so exact locations. Any location prediction would be referring to Census tract grid within the fire departments coverage area.
