## OCTOBER 5th 2020 - DAY 5 - DAILY LOG ##

* What to do today?

Thinking ahead to the project I want to work on I am just looking at resources for login and some designing of the system.
Project WITS 2.0 (is a lightweight warehouse inventory tracking system... hence, WITS)

## Requirements: ##

* Flask
* Database - postgres?
* Login - track users

You might ask why a project that is Data Science related? This is more taking the Python skills and learning by doing a project to advance knowledge of the language. These skills could be used once I have the Data Science skills added to setup dashboard interfaces to this data.

    Will be using RealPython.com as a reference more too.
